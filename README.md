Nerves.Bootstrap is an Elixir archive that brings Nerves support to Elixir's Mix
build tool and provides a new project generator, `mix nerves.new`.

We recommend reading the [Nerves Installation
Guide](https://hexdocs.pm/nerves/installation.html) for installing and using
Nerves. Read on for details specific to Nerves.Bootstrap.

## Installation

The first time you use Nerves and whenever you update your Elixir installation,
run the follow to install the official archive:

```bash
mix archive.install hex nerves_bootstrap
```

From then on, Nerves.Bootstrap checks for new versions and will let you know. To
manually upgrade either run the above line or the following:

```bash
mix local.nerves
```

If you need to force a specific version, run:

```bash
mix archive.install hex nerves_bootstrap 1.0.1
```

## Mix tasks

This section provides a high level overview of Mix tasks provided by
Nerves.Bootstrap. For additional details, run `mix help task`.

### mix nerves.new

A mix task for creating new Nerves projects.

```bash
mix nerves.new my_project
```

The generated project will support compilation for all of the officially
supported Nerves devices. Just like the Elixir new project generator,
`nerves.new` supports many options to tweak the output.

Generated projects will boot and provide an IEx prompt over the default console
for the device. Here's a script for creating a new project and building it for a
Raspberry Pi 3:

```bash
mix nerves.new my_project
cd my_project

# Set MIX_TARGET to select Raspberry Pi 3-specific dependencies in the mix.exs
export MIX_TARGET=rpi3

# Download dependencies, build firmware and write it to a MicroSD card
mix deps.get
mix firmware
mix burn
```

Generated projects include [NervesPack](https://hex.pm/packages/nerves_pack) in
their dependency list. NervesPack depends on most of the Nerves-specific
libraries that you'll need at the beginning of your project. This includes those
needed for networking, firmware updates, and various helpful utilities.  If you
want a minimal project that does not include NervesPack, pass
`--no-nerves-pack`:

```bash
mix nerves.new my_new_nerves_project --no-nerves-pack
```

### mix local.nerves

This task checks [hex.pm](https://hex.pm/packages/nerves_bootstrap) for updates
to the `nerves_bootstrap` archive. If one exists, you'll be prompted to update.

## Integration with your project

Nerves.Bootstrap injects Nerves-specific build tasks into the `mix` build process via
an `Application.start/1` call in your project's `config.exs`. If you use `mix
nerves.new`, your project will be created with these lines and no additional
work is needed.

```elixir
# config/config.exs
import Config

Application.start(:nerves_bootstrap)
```

## Internals

Nerves.Bootstrap uses Mix aliases to hook into Mix build steps.

Aliases vary based on whether you are compiling for your host or your target
device. For host builds, Nerves.Bootstrap injects the following tasks to add
support for downloading pre-compiled archives.

```elixir
[
  "deps.get": ["deps.get", "nerves.bootstrap", "nerves.deps.get"],
  "deps.update": ["deps.update", "nerves.bootstrap", "nerves.deps.get"]
]
```

When `MIX_TARGET` is set, Nerves.Bootstrap injects the following additional
tasks to support cross-compilation and firmware creation:

```elixir
[
  "deps.loadpaths": ["nerves.bootstrap", "nerves.loadpaths", "deps.loadpaths"],
  "deps.compile": ["nerves.bootstrap", "nerves.loadpaths", "deps.compile"],
  # This is just helper to prevent trying to run tasks on host that were
  # compiled for a target
  run: [Nerves.Bootstrap.Aliases.run/1]
]
```

Nerves.Bootstrap provides only minimal code to inject the Nerves tooling. The
main Nerves tooling is the [`Nerves`](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves)
library.

## Local development

If you need to modify Nerves.Bootstrap, here's what you should do to get
the source code, build it and install your changes locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_bootstrap.git
cd nerves_bootstrap
mix do deps.get, archive.build, archive.install
```
